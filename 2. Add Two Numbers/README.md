You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.<br>

 

<strong>Example 1:</strong><br>


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]<br>
Output: [7,0,8]<br>
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.<br>
<strong>Example 2:</strong>

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]<br>
Output: [0]<br>
<strong>Example 3:</strong><br>

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]<br>
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]<br>
 <br>

Constraints:<br>

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].<br>
0 <= Node.val <= 9<br>
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
